## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

# Project Descriprion

This project is about creating a landing page with a nav-bar created dynamically through javascript and adjusting sections styling by applying css classes to the section
in the viewport detected by the "getBoundingClientRect()" which returns a rectangle DOM object with a lot of useful properties learned from this reference "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect"
and also navigating smoothly using anchors but not by the default functionality using "scrollIntoView" method
